# Todo API made with Lumen framework

I haven't used lumen in a long time so this was a really nice refreshment.

to get started you can use the following commands:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

and then you can use the following commands:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```

The Postman Collection to test todo-api [here](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/ff78c6c51059d3e58b0f).

There are few things that I would personally improve on this app

1. I would make authentication a bit more secure.
2. I would make test cases more thorough.
